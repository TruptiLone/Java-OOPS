# Java Arithmetic Operations and GCD Calculator

## Overview

This Java program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) and computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers passed as command-line arguments.

### Features:
- Takes two integers as command-line arguments.
- Performs the following operations:
  - **Addition**
  - **Subtraction**
  - **Multiplication**
  - **Division**
  - **Modulus**
  - **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**
- Validates the input to ensure exactly two integers are provided.
- Handles division by zero and other errors gracefully.

## Requirements:
- Java (version 8 or higher) must be installed.
- IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE for development.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the program using your IDE or from the command line.
3. Run the program from the terminal with two integers as arguments:

   ```bash
   java LastnameFirstnameA1 <number1> <number2>

### Concepts Covered:
- Command-line arguments in Java
- Input validation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling for division by zero
